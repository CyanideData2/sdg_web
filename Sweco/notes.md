## NBS
* Nature Based Solutions are solutions that prioritize the health of the ecosystem
### How are they implemented?
* They go with the flow of nature rather than trying to suppress it
* Green and blue infracture => Infrastructure system based on connecting NBS with regular "Grey" infrastructure.

### What are their benefits? 
* Concrete is hard and creates noise, biomass is soft and trees damp the sound
* NBS cools down cities
* Prevent floods

### NBS examples?
* Demineralization => removing mineral (rock, asphalt)  
    * Makes floor more permeable
* Restoring natural water cycles
* Reforestation of cities

### Requirements
* Collaboration between different sectors of the industry
* Community engagement, these spaces must integrate organically otherwise they will just be an annoyance => Sense of ownership--

## US
### Considerations
* Focus on the community
* Literally do Prague for free
    * Emotional plans

### Brainstorming
* Cast nature
