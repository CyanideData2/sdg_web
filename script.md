## Problem

The intensifying effects of climate change are placing increasing strain on urban infrastructure, resulting in a rise in potholes, flooding incidents, and damage to public transportation and roads.
Though the biggest buildings and bridges are closely monitored, minor infrastructure issues are hard to predict, yet they can limit accessibility for residents.
Neighbours can submit requests and complains, but research shows that, without a proper feedback loop, these can feel impactless.
